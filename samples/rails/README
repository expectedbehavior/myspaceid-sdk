Overview of the samples in this directory:
-------------------------------------------

	The samples have been unified into a single rails project for simplicity.

	openid-combined-consumer:
	-------------------------
	This sample demonstrates an OpenID "Combined Consumer" by
	implementing the openid/oauth "hybrid" spec as specified at:
	http://step2.googlecode.com/svn/spec/openid_oauth_extension/latest/openid_oauth_extension.html
	
	This sample also demostrates the interaction with MySpace using
	the MySpace library to fetch the user's profile and friends data


	oauth:
	------
	This sample demonstrates an OAuth Consumer application by
	implementing the oauth delegated access flow ("3 legged oauth").
	Once the User authrizes the Consumer's request, it fetches the
	user's profile and friend information using the library.

    NOTE: Please note that in the samples above we store the access
          token in the session. But, in a real application you would
          probably need to store it an the user database so that you
          can call the MySpace API methods in the future using the
          stored access token

	8-bit Music:
	------------
	This sample demonstrates using a popup window with directed
	identity to do OpenID/OAuth without leaving the main page.  It
	also demonstrates activity streams.


Running the sample applications:
--------------------------------

	The samples provided in this directory are based on Ruby on Rails
	2.2. Most of these files are boilerplate code generated by rails.
	The main files to look at are:

		sample/app/controllers/openid_controller.rb
		sample/app/views/openid/index.rhtml

		sample/app/controllers/oauth_controller.rb
		sample/app/views/oauth/index.rhtml
		sample/app/views/oauth/profile.rhtml

		sample/app/controllers/user_controller.rb
		sample/app/views/user/index.rhtml
		sample/app/views/user/complete.rhtml
		sample/public/javascripts/myspaceid.rev.0.js

	To run the samples, please follow these steps:

	   1. Type `server/start' from the sample root directory
	      (samples/rails/sample). This should fire up your local
	      instance of the web server and will start listening on port
	      3000
	   
	   2. You can access the sample from your browser by navigating to
		  http://localhost:3000
	 
	The application key and secret that come with the SDK will only
	work if you are running the web server on localhost, i.e. the same
	machine as the web browser you are using.  If you want to run the
	code on a different machine, you must go to:

	http://developer.myspace.com/modules/apps/pages/CreateAppAccount.aspx

	to create a new MySpace application.  Make sure to select the
	"Create MySpaceID App" link and complete the application creation
	process.  Copy the new application's consumer key and secret to
	the file consumer_key.rb located in the same directory as this
	README.

	IMPORTANT: The domain on which you run your server MUST be entered
	as a realm on your MySpace app configuration page.  In order for
	the rails samples to work you MUST INCLUDE A SLASH AT THE END OF
	YOUR DOMAIN, e.g. http://your-domain:3000/, when you enter it as a
	realm.
